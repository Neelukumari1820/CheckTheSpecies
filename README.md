# CheckTheSpecies
By having the details like sepal length ,sepal width, petal width and petal length you can classify the flowering species .The dataset used in this repository only classifies the flowering plants into 3 classes( setosa , versicolor ,virginica) mainly .


Model is trained using two algorithm DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER and LOGISTIC REGRESSION .
You can use either of the two algorithm as both are giving same accuracy .

If you want to make a simple interface for this model you can use gradio .(Don't foget  convert the document in pickle format ).
